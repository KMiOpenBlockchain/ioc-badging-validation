  "description": "The LSE 2021 Python Coding Challenge focussed on financial services, utilising a cutting-edge virtual exchange developed by our employer sponsor, Optiver. Participants worked in interdisciplinary teams to develop trading algorithms in Python, testing and then optimising the algorithm's performance to achieve the best possible trading outcome. They then presented their processes and learning to a panel of judges from LSE Careers, LSE Digital Skills Lab, and employer-sponsor Optiver.",

    "narrative": "Holders of this badge participated in the 2021 Python Coding Challenge by Optiver and were part of the team judged to have most effectively applied the learning provided to the final project and competition. The judging panel consisted of LSE staff from the Careers Service and Digital Skills Lab, and Optiver's Lecturer and Head of Academic Partnerships.\n\nParticipants were provided with foundational Python training, in addition to receiving trading specific lectures and training from industry partner Optiver. Participants then applied this knowledge to the set challenge problem and were asked to explain how they applied and extended their coding skills as part of the final presentation submitted to the judging panel. Winners of this award demonstrated strong peer learning and support, were able to explain how they extended their learning beyond the training provided to them, and showed the greatest growth in skills and capability as judged by the panel."
