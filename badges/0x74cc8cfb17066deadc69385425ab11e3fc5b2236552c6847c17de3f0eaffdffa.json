healthcare (e.g., imaging and genomics interpretation, clinical diagnostic evaluations, prediction of readmission risk, extracting semantic information from text) and the challenges in deployment and usage of these in health and clinical settings (e.g., population data and algorithmic bias, explainability of results, robust regulation and quality control, metrics vs clinical applicability, ethics and unintended negative consequences)\nii.\tDiscusses the opportunities and challenges with using real-world health data for analysis and to drive decision-making\niii.\tExplains the ethical, legal
