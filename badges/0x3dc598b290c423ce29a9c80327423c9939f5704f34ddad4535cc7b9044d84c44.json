  "description": "The MISDI Code Camp 2021 was delivered via a combination of online synchronous lectures, events, and independent group work and self-study. Working in groups of two, attendees applied their skills to a different dataset each day, based on the popular Makeover Monday social data weekly challenge. \n\nOver the week, attendees developed a small portfolio of 3 pieces of work showcasing their data analysis and visualisation skills, before applying all of their learning to a final project at the end of the week. For their final project, attendees and their partner visualised a dataset related to airline seat price evaluation and marketing before sharing their project with the rest of the MISDI team.\n",
