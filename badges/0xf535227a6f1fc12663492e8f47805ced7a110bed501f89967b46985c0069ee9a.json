  "description": "In today's world, we are often presented with conflicting information from different sources. Being able to critically analyse and assess this information is a key skill. This course introduces you to digital argument mapping to help you analyse information locked up in text. It will show you how to write small computer programs to help you assess information, draw conclusions and make decisions. Some parts of the course will make use of the popular Python programming language - useful not just for numerical calculations, but also, for instance, reasoning about sentences and sets of objects.",
